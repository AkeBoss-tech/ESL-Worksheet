Claire asked her teachers anyways. Some of them said yes, and some of them said no. One week later, Ms. Hershey gave Claire a letter of recommendation in an envelope. Claire wasn't supposed to open it, but she really wanted to know what Ms. Hershey wrote. Claire carefully tore it open and read the letter. She was disappointed. Ms. Hershey didn't write anything interesting about Claire. Ms. Hershey just wrote that Claire was a smart, nice girl. Claire couldn't get into her top schools with that letter. Claire asked her swim coach to write her a letter of recommendation.
