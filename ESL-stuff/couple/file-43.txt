Mike was sitting at home with Maria one Saturday afternoon. The two of them were feeling bored. The television was on in front of them, but there wasn't anything interesting to watch. Suddenly a commercial began to play. "Come this Saturday evening to watch the Los Angeles Dodgers play against their rivals," the voice in the commercial said. "Are you thinking what I'm thinking," Mike asked Maria. "Let's go to the baseball game tonight!" she answered. Mike smiled and nodded his head.    Mike had never been to a Major League baseball game and neither had Maria. Baseball is known as America's Pastime. Mike liked watching baseball on television from time to time. He had always wanted to go to a stadium to witness a game firsthand. He had heard from his co-workers that it was a lot fun going to the games. Although Maria did not like watching sports as much as Mike did, she was still excited about going to a stadium to watch a baseball game in person. She was curious about how much tickets cost, so she asked Mike the question. "Are baseball tickets expensive, Mike?" she asked. "They're not cheap, unfortunately," Mike answered. Mike then told her not to worry because he had been saving money for an occasion such as this one. As the day progressed, Mike and Maria did some chores around the house and changed into their clothes for the evening ahead. The baseball game would start in a few hours. Mike and Maria had to leave early to buy the tickets. They soon took off for the stadium. The line was long when they got to the box office where they sold tickets. Mike and Maria got in line and waited for nearly an hour before they bought their tickets. After buying them, they went inside the stadium and found their seats. Their seats were rather close to the baseball field. Mike thought they might have the best seats in the stadium. The game didn't start for another thirty minutes.
