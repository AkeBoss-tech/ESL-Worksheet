A few weeks ago, Maria had met up with a childhood friend. Maria ran into her at a store. Her name was Mary. Mary and Maria had attended high school together. The two were inseparable back in those days. After high school, Maria and Mary went their own separate ways. Maria worked for a couple of years and then decided to go to college. Mary pursued a career in writing.    Maria regretted not keeping touch with her best friend after high school. She was thrilled to see her when she ran into her at the store.

They exchanged cell phone numbers and said their goodbyes. Then weeks passed by, and Maria, busy with school and her boyfriend, still had not taken the time to dial Mary's number. And then one day she finally did, and Mary answered the phone. "Hello," Mary answered. "Mary, it's Maria calling. Want to have lunch together this afternoon?" "Sure! I don't see why not?" Mary replied. Maria and Mary agreed to meet up at a sandwich shop at two o'clock. Maria looked forward to talking to her old friend again. Meanwhile, Mike was lounging in the living room watching the local news. He noticed Maria was getting ready to leave soon. "Where are you going?" he asked, casually. "I'm going out with a friend," she replied. "This better not be a guy," he said, jokingly. Maria told him not to worry; that it was an old girlfriend from high school. Maria grabbed her bag and said goodbye to Mike. "I'll be back in a couple of hours," she said, kissing him. She drove her car a few miles to the sandwich shop. She sat down at a table and waited for Mary to arrive. A few minutes later, Mary walked in through the door and spotted Maria sitting down. She walked over to her.44. Maria's Childhood Friend (B)
