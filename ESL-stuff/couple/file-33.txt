Mike was driving Maria and her mother to an antique shop. It was a Sunday afternoon, and the sky was clear that day. There were many antique shops in the city of Pasadena. They had not yet made up their minds on which antique shop to visit. "Which antique shop would you guys like to go to?" Mike asked as the car stopped at a red light.    Maria looked at her mother, who was sitting in the back seat. "Did you hear that, Mom?" she asked, noticing her mother was gazing out a car window. Janet simply shrugged her shoulders and replied, "I don't know. Any antique shop is fine with me." Maria then turned to Mike, who was focusing on the road. "It looks like it's your call, dear," she said, hopefully. But Mike was not ready to answer her. In his head, Mike was certainly no antique expert, but he did know the city and was trying to remember which shop was the closest. That way they could save both time and gasoline. Suddenly, he smiled and blurted out. "I know exactly where to go!" It was warm day in Pasadena. Maria began to sweat a little in her seat. "Mike, can you lower my window please?" Maria asked Mike. Mike looked into the interior rearview mirror and could see MariaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother. "How are you doing back there, Janet? Are you also feeling warm?" She answered, "I'm feeling a little warm." Mike lowered the windows in the car to let some more air in. "That's better, thanks," Maria said to Mike. They soon arrived at the antique shop and parked in the parking lot. They exited the car and went inside the antique shop. When Mike stepped inside the shop, he was greeted with the scent of musk and the smell of old furniture. Maria stepped inside and noticed all the different things that were being sold. Janet, right away, began to look around the antique shop.33. Antique Shopping (B)
