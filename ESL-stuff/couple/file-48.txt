Mike sat next to Maria in his car. He had finally asked Maria the question that had been on his mind for weeks. Mike had asked Maria to marry him. It hadn't gone as planned, mainly because he never really came up with a plan. Mike had wanted to pop the question to Maria somewhere special, but changed when Maria figured out his plan - or the lack of one. When Maria answered yes, the two of them were parked on a street across from a liquor store.    Still, the evening had been a perfect one. The night was cool and calm. There were stars and a moon, radiant and full. The streets were quiet. There weren't a lot of people walking around and even less cars on the roads. The stillness of the night added to the special moment Mike and Maria were sharing in their car - right in front of that liquor store! Maria was overwhelmed with emotion. The love of her life had proposed to her, and she had said yes! Mike, usually not so emotional, was absolutely thrilled. His heart had been racing prior to asking Maria the question. It was still racing now, not from being nervous but out of excitement. Maria had said yes to spending the rest of her life with him! Mike was bursting with joy. He still couldn't believe it. "Are... are you sure, Maria?" he asked his wide-eyed fiancÃ©e. Maria reached for Mike's hands and looked straight into his eyes. "I've never been more sure about anything in my life," she answered, tears swelling up. Mike's eyes began to tear up, too, when he noticed Maria. It was a shared moment they would never forget.48.
