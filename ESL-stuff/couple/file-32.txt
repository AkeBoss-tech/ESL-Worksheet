The sun rose that Sunday morning brightly over the city of Pasadena. Mike and Maria slept soundly in their bedroom while Maria's mother slept in the living room. Mike had purchased an inflatable bed for her to sleep on. Maria's mother, Janet, at first wanted Mike to sleep in the living room so she could sleep with Maria in the bedroom. Mike had agreed, but Maria objected to her mother's request. Mike was grateful for Maria's intervention. He did not want to sleep on the couch overnight.    He had slept on the couch once by accident and had awoken the next day with back pains. Janet also refused to sleep on the couch. She insisted that Mike and Maria made accommodations for her. It was Maria who thought of the idea of buying an inflatable bed for Janet to sleep on. "We don't have one of those, Maria," Mike told Maria when she told him of the idea. "That's why you are going to have to go and buy one, Mike," Maria retorted. Maria had also become annoyed by her mother's constant demands. But Mike and Maria felt they had no choice but to listen to Janet. Janet awoke that Sunday early in the morning. She began to clean around the house to kill time until Mike and Maria woke up. Maria woke up before Mike, as usual. And as usual, she woke up Mike and told him about the plans they had made the night before. "Mike, wake up. We're supposed to go antique shopping today with my mother," Maria said, shaking Mike awake from his slumber. "Can't we go tomorrow," Mike said. "My mother will be gone by tomorrow," Maria replied. Mike and Maria both got out of bed and got ready to go out. Within the hour, Mike and Maria were ready to leave. Maria walked into the living room and was surprised to find the apartment perfectly tidy and clean.32. The Next Morning (B)
