It had been three days since Mike last talked to Maria at the coffee shop. He had finally mustered up the courage to talk to her. Mike had succeeded in not just talking to her, but he had managed to get her phone number as well. Mike felt like the happiest guy in the world. He knew there was something special about Maria. She was not like any other girls he had met before.    Mike knew he had to play his cards right if he wished to impress Maria enough for her to want to stay with him. He had to be the perfect gentlemen. Maria had been waiting for Mike to call her. She thought Mike had made a good first impression at the coffee shop and wanted to get to know him more. Three days had gone by, but she had yet to receive a phone call from him. She wondered what was taking him so long. Mike had butterflies in his stomach. He was feeling nervous about calling her and kept postponing it for the next day. On the fifth day he forced himself to pick up the phone and dial her number. He gathered up his courage again like he did the first time he spoke to her at the coffee shop, and dialed her number. He carefully dialed the phone number she had given him on that faithful day, 867-5309. The phone rang on the other side. Maria was sitting at home when her cell phone rang. She picked it up to see who was calling and gasped with excitement when she saw the name Mike Smith on the caller ID. She sat up and answered the call. Mike heard a voice answer the call.3.
