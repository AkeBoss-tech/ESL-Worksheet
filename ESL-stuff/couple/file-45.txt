Mike was home alone for a few hours. Maria had gone out to see a friend from high school. He was sitting down on the couch watching the news. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon, and Mike decided to give his best friend a call. He grabbed his cell phone and dialed Doug's number. The phone rang for a few seconds. "Hello," Doug answered. "Hey, Doug, it's Mike. What are you up to?" Mike asked.    Doug told Mike that he was at the cleaners picking up some pants. Mike invited Doug to come over and hang out for a bit. "Sure, Mike. I'll head over in few," Doug responded. Mike said thanks and hung up the phone. Doug arrived shortly and knocked on the door. Mike answered the door and let Doug inside. "Hey, Doug. Come on in," Mike said to Doug. Doug patted Mike on the back and asked him how he was. Mike said he was feeling pensive. Doug sat down on the living room couch. Mike offered Doug a drink. Doug asked him if he had any beer, but Mike wasn't allowed to drink in the apartment. "Sorry, Doug, it's Maria's rule," Mike explained. Doug then asked Mike for a soft drink. "That I'm allowed to have in the house," Mike said, cheerfully. Mike went to the kitchen and grabbed a couple of cans of Coca-Cola. He came back into the living room and sat down with Doug. They opened their cans and began sipping the ice-cold Coke.45. Mike and Doug's Meet-up (A)
