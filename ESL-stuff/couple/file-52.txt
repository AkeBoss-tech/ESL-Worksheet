Mike and Maria were once again taking a stroll at the town mall, Old Town Pasadena. Mike was carrying a shopping bag for Maria, who had purchased a few items at the store. Maria had bought a few things for the kitchen. Mike, as usual, was stuck with the task of being the carrier. A few hours had passed since they had first arrived.

"I hope you are kidding," Mike replied. Maria looked straight ahead as they continued walking. They were nearing the exit and Mike saw the opportunity to bring up leaving.52.
