The big day had finally come. At last, Maria was to receive her degree up on a stage at her university. She was as excited as she was nervous. Mike tried helping Maria get over her stage fright by telling her to picture everybody in the audience wearing only underwear. "This is no time for jokes, Mike. I'm graduating in seven hours," she said, sounding almost a little scared. "I have to get ready," she said. She walked upstairs to change, and Mike followed to get dressed as well.    Mike got ready within the hour. Maria had only managed to shower during that same time period. "Maria, how much longer are you going to be?" he asked, earnestly. "You should know by now that I require at least three hours to fully get ready," she said back to Mike. Mike told Maria he was stepping out to buy a few things from the grocery store, and that he would return in one hour. Maria had no objection, and Mike left their apartment. Mike got into his recently repaired car and drove to a flower shop. He planned on surprising Maria with dozens of flowers on their return to the apartment from the graduation. He paid for the order and delivery, giving specific directions on where and when to leave the flowers. Mike handed the flower shop owner a key to their apartment so that he could deliver the flowers inside. Mike took a little longer than he had said he would, but to his surprise Maria was already dressed and ready to go by the time he returned home. "How do I look?" Maria asked, sporting an elegant-looking blue graduation robe. "You look like a million dollars," Mike replied and urgently kissed her on the lips. All things were set so Mike and Maria drove off to the university where they arrived a few hours early. For Maria, they had arrived just in time. Maria told her soon-to-be husband to find a good seat and relax for a while. The graduation was taking place inside a spacious auditorium. Mike shared some comforting words to Maria before they parted.57. Graduation Day (B)
