Mike was ready to ask Maria to take his hand in marriage. He had purchased the ring a few days ago at a jewelry store. Mike was now waiting for the right moment to ask Maria the big question. The moment had to be perfect. He had thought about it for days about when and where it should be. Mike considered taking Maria to a park and asking her there. Mike also thought about taking Maria out for a romantic dinner. There were so many possibilities, but Mike could not make up his mind.    One morning as Mike was getting up from bed, he thought of just asking her right there and then. Maria was sleeping beside him when he got the idea. Mike quietly crept to the dresser to open a drawer. He reached under his clothes and grabbed the ring he had bought. He walked next to Maria on the bed and whispered her name. Maria slightly opened her eyes and saw Mike standing over her. Before she could see what he was holding in his hand, a nervous Mike suddenly got a bad case of cold feet. Instantly he hid the ring behind his back. "Mike, what are you doing?" Maria asked drowsily. Maria rubbed her eyes so she could see more clearly. "Nothing, honey. I was just... looking at how beautiful you look while sleeping," Mike cleverly answered. The even more clever Maria did not believe what he said and became even more suspicious. "Why do you have your hand behind your back?" she asked when she noticed Mike's awkward stance. Mike became nervous and suddenly changed the topic. "Let's go out somewhere special tonight! What do you say, dear?" Mike asked enthusiastically. "Umm, sure," Maria replied. Later that night, Mike and Maria were out driving around town. Mike wasn't sure where to take Maria. As Mike wondered where to go, Maria sat in the passenger seat asking Mike where they were going. It was a beautiful, clear night in Pasadena with stars in the sky and a big full moon.47.
