Everyone at Jefferson High School was reading How to Save a Life, which was a book about a student's journey in medical school. The book got really popular around the United States. It will become a movie some time in 2021. Some students were ahead of others in the book. Some students were already done with the book. Laura was halfway through with the book. She really liked it and could hardly put it down. She just finished the chapter where the main character falls in love with a patient who is dying of cancer. Laura's friends already finished the book, so she told them not to give any spoilers. Spoilers are parts of the story that reveal important details before a person gets to that part of the story. Spoilers ruin the fun of not knowing. It's like knowing how a movie ends when you are just starting to watch the movie. Laura's friend was about to say something about the book, but Laura stopped her. "No spoilers, guys! I want to enjoy this book," she said. Laura was reading the book on the bus. A couple on the bus started talking about the book. Laura started to panic. She put on her headphones and listened to music throughout the entire bus ride. Laura continued reading the book when she got home. Her mom came into her room. "That is such a good book! I'm so glad you're reading it. Have you got to the part when the main character is told she also has cancer?" her mom said. "MOM! I'm only halfway!" Laura exclaimed. Her mom apologized. Laura put the book back in her bookshelf and never touched it again.
