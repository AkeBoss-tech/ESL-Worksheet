Rose is lactose intolerant, which means that she is allergic to dairy products. Dairy products include milk, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt. Rose hates that she cannot eat ice cream without getting a stomachache. It is something she has to deal with, though. She is okay with not eating things like cheese and milk. When Rose eats dairy products, she will get a really bad stomachache. They would be so bad to the point where she could not walk. One day in class, Rose's classmate was giving everyone noodles. Rose took a bite. It was pretty good! She had never tried anything like it before. A few minutes after she finished it, however, her stomach started hurting. Did the noodles have milk in it? Noodles did not usually have milk in it. Rose asked her classmate what was in it. He said there was a little bit of milk. Rose got mad at him. "Hey, I didn't know you were lactose intolerant!" he said. Rose could not get out of her chair. At the end of the class, Mr. Thompson asked Rose if she could move. "I literally cannot move," she said. Mr. Thompson stayed in the class until 6 p.m., which was when her stomach stopped hurting. Rose thanked Mr. Thompson for staying with her. Rose went back home and promised that she would ask about the ingredients before eating anything!
