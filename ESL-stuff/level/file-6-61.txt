Maria was an intern at a law firm. Her eventual goal was to become an environmental lawyer. Getting an internship was a great way to learn more and make her resume look better. The internship was unpaid, but she was okay with that. Maria was nervous on her first day. She made sure she looked professional. She wore a white collared shirt, a navy blue blazer, a pencil skirt, and black heels. She put her hair in a ponytail and wore a pearl necklace. Maria entered the law firm and looked around her. Everyone looked so busy and professional. She liked that. Maria went to her boss Susan. Susan has been a lawyer for twenty years and won many of her cases. Susan looked mean, but Maria was ready to make her like her. Maria and Susan shook hands. Susan had a firm grip. "First, I want you to get me a cup of coffee. No creamer or sugar," she said. "Sure! What would you like me to do next?" Maria asked. "I'll let you know after you get me my coffee," Susan said. Maria came back with the coffee. Susan took the coffee and drank it. "Okay, now I want you to drive to the nearest grocery store and buy my groceries," she said. Maria was shocked. She thought she would be doing more important work. "What does this have to do with law?" Maria asked. "Are you questioning my knowledge of law?" usan asked. Maria immediately froze. She shook her head no. She obeyed her orders and then sent Susan an email saying that she quit.
