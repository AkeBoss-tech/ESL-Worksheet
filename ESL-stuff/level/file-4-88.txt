Karen was hungry. Her mom did not make any food. She was home all alone. She decided to make a sandwich. She was going to make a super sandwich. She first started with bread. She then spread mayonnaise and mustard on it. She also added different types of meat. She had bolognese, ham, and bacon. She decided she could not  have all meat. She added lettuce, tomatoes, spinach, and cilantro. She added a special twist by adding chips and avocados to her sandwich. She knew this was going to taste amazing. She got a plate and sat down. She was ready to eat her sandwich.
