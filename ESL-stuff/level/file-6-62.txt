Margaret always liked taking pictures. She believed that a picture can make anything beautiful. She brought her camera everywhere even if she was doing simple tasks like going grocery shopping. Margaret especially liked taking pictures of her friends when they didn't expect it. She liked capturing people's natural reactions. Some of Margaret's friends didn't like it when she did this though. Margaret had a website where she put samples of her photography. There were some pictures of people, some pictures of views, and some pictures of food. She decided to offer her skills for money. People could fill out a form on her website requesting her to take pictures of them. Her rate was $30 per hour. She wasn't getting that many requests. It made her feel like her work wasn't good. Her friend suggested advertising her website on social media. Once she did that, more requests came in. Day after day, people would request Margaret to take their pictures. In June, there were over 50 requests because people wanted graduation pictures. Margaret had to stop taking requests though because she was too busy. Margaret made a lot of money from taking pictures. She used the money to buy a new camera.
