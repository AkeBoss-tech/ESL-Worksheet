Before a new year, people make resolutions. Resolutions are things you want to change about yourself or things you want to happen. Common New Year resolutions include losing weight, getting good grades, spending less, and traveling more. It is hard to achieve resolutions because we can fall back into our old habits easily and make excuses. In December, gyms are almost empty. People are sitting comfortably at home eating. Once it hits the new year, gyms are crowded with people hoping to lose weight. Sadly, people will start losing hope and get lazy. It is easy to eat unhealthy food and not exercise. Well, it takes a lot of willpower to stay healthy for a long period of time. Kathleen's resolution is to lose weight. She currently weighs 150 pounds at 5'4".

She decided to buy it for the entire year instead of month by month as a way to stop herself from canceling. It costs $200 for a whole year. The gym has everything she needs. There is even a spa in the gym. Kathleen went to the gym every day for two weeks. After two weeks, however, Kathleen had to go back to school. She had less time to go to the gym.
