Carol is the secretary of Project Serve, a club at McKinsey High School that gave students the opportunity to volunteer. Under Project Serve, students could volunteer at a hospital, library, orphanage, food drive, beach, and more. There is something for everyone. There are over 100 students in the club. This is probably because it looks good for college applications. Carol feels that she does so much for the club, even more than the president. Carol is the one who talks to all the partner organizations and organizes the volunteering events. This is the president's job. She also takes attendance, organizes all the documents and files, and promotes the club around school. The president, Jessica, is only president because she is popular and knows how to sell herself. Jessica always asks Carol to do all the work. Carol let Jessica do this for almost 6 months. Carol decides to tell Jessica that she feels underappreciated. "Hey Jessica, I have been wanting to say this for a long time. I feel underappreciated. I am basically doing my job and your job," Carol says. "Okay, then you're fired. You don't have to do either job now," Jessica says. Carol gasps. She did not realize that Jessica had that much power.
