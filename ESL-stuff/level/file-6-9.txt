Edward really liked Natalie. The Sadie Hawkins dance, where girls ask guys out, was coming up. In other dances guys usually ask girls out. Natalie liked Edward, too, but he did not know. Natalie was thinking about asking Edward to the dance, but she was shy. Her friends eventually convinced Natalie to ask him. During the lunch break, Natalie and her friends went up to Edward at his usual lunch table. "Hi Edward. This song is for you," Natalie said. He looked shocked. Natalie took out her guitar. Her friends took out their instruments, too. Natalie played an original song. The song was about how they met on the first day of 9th grade. At the end of the song, Natalie asked, "Will you go to Sadie with me?" There was a long pause. Everyone around Edward was waiting for his response. Edward said yes, but he didn't look too happy. After school, Natalie asked Edward why he looked upset when she asked him out. "I really like you, but I'm not a dancer," Edward said. Natalie laughed. "Who cares? No one is really good at dancing. The important thing is that you have fun," Natalie said. Edward nodded and decided to go out with her. At the dance, Edward felt awkward at first. Then, Natalie started dancing, and it was bad. Edward laughed, and started dancing, too. Even though they were both awkward, they had fun.
