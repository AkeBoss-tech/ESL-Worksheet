Deborah is running for Homecoming Queen at the high school she just transferred to a few days ago. Deborah and Sarah put up posters. The poster had a picture of Deborah with her list of accomplishments and characteristics. Deborah was a pageant contestant a couple of years ago, a 4.0 student, and a volunteer at the animal shelter. Classmates came up to Deborah after school to tell her how great she was. Deborah thanked them. Sarah came up to Deborah after school. "Hi, I'm Sarah. Look, I wanted to give you some advice. I think you should drop out of the Homecoming race. You're a new student," she said. "I know and I think that this is a great opportunity to get to meet people. I've already met so many people since running for Homecoming Queen," Deborah said. "Don't say I didn't warn you," Sarah said. Deborah wore a long gold dress to Homecoming. Her parents were so proud of her and they took a lot of pictures of their daughter. Deborah went to Homecoming with Kimberly and some other friends. The Homecoming dance was inside the gym. It was decorated nicely. Deborah danced with her friends. A guy asked Deborah to dance, but she said no. Later, the principal came out on the stage. He was going to announce the Homecoming Queen and King. "Your Homecoming Queen is ... Deborah!" he said. Deborah was happily surprised. People cheered for her and said kind words. Sarah rolled her eyes and left the dance. Deborah went up to the stage and made a speech about taking chances. She was off to a good start at her new school.
