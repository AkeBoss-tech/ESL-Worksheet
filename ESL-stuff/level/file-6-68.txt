At Sunflower Middle School, the 8th graders would all go to the amusement park to celebrate the graduation and finally entering high school. Robert's group of friends were all excited to go, but he wasn't. The truth was that Robert was afraid of heights. A lot of the rides at the amusement park were fast and high. Robert didn't want to admit to his friends that he was afraid of heights. They would probably make fun of him and tell him he's not being a man. Robert told his teacher that he had a family trip that day. "But Robert, it's a free trip to one of the most popular amusement parks in America!" his teacher said. His friend overheard Robert saying he could not go. "Robert, you have to go! Don't you want to spend time with us? We're all going to different high schools," Michael said. This was true. Maybe he can just go on the rides that are not roller coasters. Michael decided to go. He did want to see his friends one last time. At the amusement park, his friends wanted to go on the tallest ride first. Robert felt his hands shaking. His friends all got in line. As they got closer to the front of the line, Robert's hands started sweating. When they reached the front, Robert couldn't move. "Robert, come on! It's our turn," one of his friends said. "I'm too scared. I can't," he said. "Just try it, you might like it," his friend said. Robert took a deep breath and went on the ride. He closed his eyes and the roller coaster took off. Robert actually liked it! He loved how the wind felt rushing against him. When they got off the ride, he wanted to go again!
