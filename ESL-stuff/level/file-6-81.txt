Diana wanted to be a model. She went to a lot of casting calls. She wanted to be hired to walk as a runway model. She also wanted to do advertisements, but those were harder to get. Diana had a hard time getting hired because she looked a lot like another model named Amy. Amy was an established model who has done many advertisements, commercials, and fashion shows. She was very famous. People did not want to hire Diana because there was already an Amy. Diana thought she looked different though. She thought her face was more round. She was also skinnier. Diana went to an audition for a Gucci commercial. Gucci is an expensive clothing and accessories brand. At the audition, Diana spotted Amy. In fact, Diana was right after her. There was no way she was going to get hired. After Amy finished her audition, Diana went up to the front. "Wow, didn't you just do your audition?" the casting director asked. "No, that was Amy. I'm Diana," she said. Diana performed her audition. She thought she did a good job. She did all the right poses. She knew she looked great, but she was worried about Amy. A couple of weeks later, Diana got a call from the casting director saying that she was hired. "Just curious, what made you guys want to hire me over Amy?" Diana asked. "We wanted someone new. Amy is everywhere," he said. Diana was so happy. She celebrated by buying herself a necklace.
