Denise, Brian, and Melissa were best friends. Denise and Melissa met each other first. They met at ballet lessons. They both hated it, and they bonded over that. Denise and Melissa met Brian during art class in 9th grade. The three were about to graduate from high school and go to different colleges. Denise was going to Boston University, Melissa was going to New York University, and Brian was going to Harvard. At least they were all going to be on the East Coast. Denise secretly had a crush on Brian. She has liked him for two years. She was glad that they were going to be nearby each other. She wanted to tell him, but she didn't know if he liked her, too. She didn't want to ruin their friendship. She admitted to Melissa that she liked Brian. She made Melissa keep it a secret. Melissa said okay. Melissa and Brian met up after school to do homework. They were working on physics. All of a sudden Brian stopped reading. "I have to tell you something," he said. "What is it?" Melissa asked. "I like Denise and I kinda want to tell her," Brian said. "TELL HER!" Melissa said. "But what if she doesn't feel the same way? It'll be awkward," he said. "I shouldn't say this, but she told me she likes you!"  Melissa said. Knowing that Denise liked him too made things easier. Brian surprised Denise with flowers and admitted that he liked her. "I do too. Wow, this is crazy. I just told Melissa yesterday that I like you," she said. "I know, she told me while we were studying," he said. Normally, Denise would be mad if Melissa broke a promise, but this time it was okay.
