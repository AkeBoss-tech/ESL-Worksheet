Then, Americans across the country go crazy. A lot of people get violent on Black Friday. One year, Carol went shopping on the day. She wanted to buy a new coat. "I hope the mall isn't too crowded," she said. She couldn't believe her eyes. Every store was flooded with people. Carol spotted a nice blue coat in one store. It was on sale for twenty dollars. Carol was about to try it on. Suddenly a lady jumped at her and took the coat away. "I'm going home," said Carol.
