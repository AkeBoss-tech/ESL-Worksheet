It had been raining for the past few days in Southern California. Every day, people would hold umbrellas and walk around with jackets. Today it was sunny. People were wearing dresses and flip-flops. It was a day for people to finally go out and get some sunshine. The sky was beautiful. The clouds were fluffy and scattered all across the sky. The sun was between the clouds. It was not too hot. The beach was one place many people decided to go on a sunny day. There were many beaches in Southern California. At the beach, the wind felt great. The water has the perfect temperature. It was perfect weather to stay at the beach. There were a lot of people there. There were kids, parents, students, and the elderly. Everyone was enjoying the beach. There were shops at the beach, too. Many food shops and carnival games were set up on the pier. With so many activities to do, one would never find oneself bored. There were long lines for the funnel cakes and candy shops. Many people took this opportunity to go surfing or to fly a kite. Some even built sand castles or worked on their tan. Everyone had a smile on his or her face. When the sun set, the sky turned a beautiful pink and orange. It was a photo worthy moment.
