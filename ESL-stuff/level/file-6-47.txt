John grew up skinny. Because of this, he was bullied a lot. Bigger guys would push him around and girls would make fun of him for being skinnier than them. John decided to transform himself in college. He took advantage of the free gym at his college, and went there every day from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. He lifted light weights at first and then moved on to heavier ones. Every three weeks, he increased the weight he lifted by five pounds. He also did push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups. He also drank protein shakes before he worked out. Protein shakes helped him gain muscle mass. John also changed his diet, too He started eating foods like beef, eggs, brown rice, and beets. In six months, John was no longer skinny. He was muscular and no one bullied him in college. He felt a lot happier, too. He felt more confident about himself and was happier going to class every day. His friends from high school noticed the change and complimented him on his healthier body. John was so inspired by his own body change that he decided to create a program teaching high schoolers how to get stronger. He first taught at his old high school, and then taught at several high schools nearby. Later he made a DVD about how to get stronger. The DVD was sold worldwide. Eventually John went on talk shows and wrote books about his journey.
