Susan's favorite band was touring. They were having a concert near her house. She was so excited since they had not been on tour for a long time. She knew that tickets would sell out really fast. She stayed up late the night they came out. She wanted  to get the tickets before they sold out. She continuously refreshed the page when the time got closer. When the tickets were released, added them to her cart on the website. She got three tickets, two for her close friends. Susan was so excited when she got the tickets. She immediately called her friends to tell them. They thanked her for helping them get tickets. She then listened to all their songs again. On the day of the concert, Susan wore her favorite band t-shirt. She got ready with her friends, and they all left together. At the venue, it was extremely crowded. There were a lot of people and security guards. It was a long line to get in. When they got in, they moved their way to the front. They wanted to get a good view of the concert. The lights turned off when the concert was about to begin. When the band came out, everyone screamed in excitement. They played some of their classic hits, but they also played new songs. They had amazing lights and instrumentals also. Susan enjoyed the concert as much as she expected she would. She could not wait for the next tour.
