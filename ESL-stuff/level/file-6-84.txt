Phyllis and her friends graduated about a week ago. They all have different plans. Phyllis is moving to New York for medical school. Tina is staying in Los Angeles and working as a medical assistant. Lori is traveling in Europe. Ruby is teaching English in China. The four girls have been best friends since their first year of college. It was hard for all of them to be away from each other. However, they accepted that they were going to do what would be best for them. Phyllis was more excited than sad. She has always wanted to go to New York. She loved the fast-pace lifestyle, the skyline, and the subway system. She was also looking forward to being around people who have the same goals as she does. Unlike Phyllis, Tina is taking a break from school. She wants to have a year of work experience before going to medical school. She is excited to take it easy. Lori is excited, too. She was going to travel by herself, and she was okay with that. She plans to visit England, Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, and more. Ruby is more nervous about moving. She has never been to China before and does not speak Chinese. She is excited for her job though. She loves teaching and seeing students' faces light up when they understand something. Although the four of them will be apart, they promised to keep in contact with each other through video chat. They agreed that they will all talk on Fridays at 8 p.m. They also agreed to meet up for big events, such as weddings and holidays.
