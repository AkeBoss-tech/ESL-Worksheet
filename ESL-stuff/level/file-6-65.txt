James was known for being clumsy. He would trip all the time, accidentally let go of objects, knock drinks off the table, and stutter over words. One day, James went to the grocery store. He was buying ingredients to make dinner. He went to the sauce aisle. He put the pesto sauce jar in his cart. As he was walking to the meat aisle to look for meatballs, the pesto jar fell through the cracks of the cart and shattered. Everyone in the store looks at James. He turns bright red. An employee nearby told James not to worry about it and cleaned the mess. James picked up a pack of meatballs. He noticed that there was a weird stain on the pack. He tried to pick at it to get rid of it. He picked it so hard that he made a hole in the package. James looked around to see if anyone saw it. Whew! No one was in the aisle. James put the package back with the others and got a new one. Next, James went to the grains aisle. There were so many options. Did he want noodles or pasta? What kind of texture did he want? James spent 20 minutes looking at all the grain types. "Sir, we are about to close," an employee said. James apologize and ended up picking the macaroni. James went to the checkout aisle. His total came out to be $10.20. He got out his dollar bills and coins. When he handed the coins to the cashier, he accidentally dropped all of his coins on the floor.
