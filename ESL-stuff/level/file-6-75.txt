Earl used to be overweight. He managed to lose fifteen pounds in two years though. He is very proud of himself. One day he went to the county fair where there were a ferris wheel, roller coasters, games, food, and contests. This was Earl's first time at the county fair. He was with his cousins. They first went on the ferris wheel. Earl loved it, because he got to see the view from above. Everything and everyone looked so small. Next, Earl and his cousins went to a ring-toss booth. Earl was really good at it. He even won the grand prize a huge stuffed dolphin. He gave it to his youngest cousin. Earl and his cousins walked around. Earl was getting hungry. He saw a cotton candy booth. He was tempted to buy one, but he was doing so good on his diet. There were a lot of good foods such as corn dog, chili cheese fries, pizza, and fried cookies. There was no healthy food though. Earl and his cousins kept walking around. They noticed a booth for a pie-eating contest. Whoever could eat the most pies would win a $50 gift certificate to Pie-O, a popular pie place in the county. Earl's cousins encouraged him to enter the contest. Earl was known for eating fast. Earl said it would be bad for his health, but he entered the contest anyway. He felt like he deserved some pie. Earl ended up winning the competition. He gave the gift certificate to the cousin who motivated him to lose weight.
