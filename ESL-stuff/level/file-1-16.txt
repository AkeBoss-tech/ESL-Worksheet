The beach is fun! Some people swim in the water. They see who is the fastest. The winner gets a surfboard. Some people lie down on the sand. They want to relax. The kids make sandcastles. They try to make the castles big and tall. Later, the water washes the sandcastles away. The kids make new ones.
