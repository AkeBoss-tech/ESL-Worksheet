Lucas was going rock climbing today. He loved hiking and biking. This was his first time rock climbing. Lucas was not scared though. He was athletic. He was actually excited. He went  with two of his friends. They had to sign a waiver first. They then got their harnesses. They started with the short wall. After they mastered that, they moved on to the larger wall. They raced to the top. Lucas got to the top first. They had a lot of fun. After rock climbing, they decided to go eat. They deserved the food after their good workout.
