      "Veterans Day is an official United States holiday observed on November 11th every year. While Memorial Day remembers those who have died while serving in any of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces -- Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard, Veterans Day honors all members of the armed forces, especially the living. As a U.S. federal holiday, government offices and schools are closed, and most people have the day off from work. Banks are also closed. If November 11th falls on a Sunday, then the holiday is observed on the following Monday. The holiday was first observed after World War I, which ended On November 11 1918. It was called Armistice Day then and was more about celebrating the absence of war and honoring those that served in that one war. It didn't become known as Veterans Day until 1954 after World War II and the Korean War, when there were many more members of the armed forces. Many restaurants offer free meals to veterans on the date. There is always a special ceremony at Arlington National Military Cemetery in Washington D.C. This ceremony involves a wreath being placed over the grave of The Unknown Soldier. Many major cities also hold parades on this date. The U.S. flag is usually flown at half-mast as a remembrance to those soldiers who have died and many ceremonies observe a moment of silence for the same reason. In Canada the holiday is called Remembrance Day. One symbol of the day is the poppy flower. The red poppy flower is said to represent or be a symbol of the blood of soldiers. Many people wear or give out poppy flowers on the day.  \n",

      "Fires are destructive. They also create changes. In 1871 a fire burned most of Chicago to the ground. Many people think the fire was started when a cow knocked over a gas lamp. Most of the city at the time was built of wood. This, combined with the famous Chicago winds and a drought, made the city burn down quickly. The fire lasted for three days. 100,000 people were left homeless, and at least 300 were killed. What was amazing was how quickly the city was rebuilt, eventually becoming the third most populous city in the United States. The Great Boston Fire of 1872 created a property damage of $73.5 million,  more than any other fire in the U.S. history. Most of Downtown Boston and the financial district burned down in the fire that began in a warehouse basement. 30 people died, and thousands lost their jobs and their homes. However, the city was rebuilt in two years. It began enforcing building regulations because of the fire. The 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City caused the fourth highest loss of life from an industrial accident in the U.S. history. 123 women and 23 men, all garment workers and mostly poor immigrants, died from the fire, smoke inhalation, or falling or jumping to their deaths. Child labor was not uncommon. The youngest victims were two 14-year-old girls who worked  in the factory. So many people died because the owners of the factory locked the doors to the stairs and exits. This was to prevent the workers from taking breaks and stealing. As a result of the fire and huge loss of life, many people began protesting poor working conditions. The U.S. Congress passed laws improving factory safety conditions. Women workers also formed a union to fight for better working conditions. \n",
